1. Data: variables
2. Logics: functions



























Out of both, data is most important part.

But in structural or procedural programming language the data insucurity is very high due to the "global variable".

bankingApp.cpp:
----------------


string customerName
int accountNumber
int balance
string branchName

void withdraw(int amt){
//amt withdraw logic
int balance = balance-amt
}

void deposit(int amt){
//amt deposit logic
balance = balance+amt
}

void transferAmount(int src, int dest, int amt){
//transfer Amount logic
}



void login(){
//Authentication and Authorization will be done
}

void logout(){

}

void changePassword(){

}



--To develop and run a Java application, we need to install a s/w called JDK(Java Development Kit)

--We can get this JDK s/w from the official website of orcale.

but there are many different vendors are available in the market, from them also we can get the JDK s/w. such as Amazon corretto..


JAVA_HOME: C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\jdk21.0.9_10

Path: C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\jdk21.0.9_10\bin



Java comes in the form of 3 categories:


1. Java SE (Standard Edition) : Core Java
2. JavaEE (Enterprise Edition): Adv Java
3. JavaME (Micro Edition): 


--Java SE is the base edition for the remaining 2 editions

--All the above editions comes in the form of a specifiction(a documentation which specifies the rules and guildelines to develop a perticular s/w)

--The implementation of the Java SE specification is the JDK s/w.


OpenJDK : which is a reference implementation of the Java SE specification.


CBSE: Java SE
NCRT: OpenJDK 
Other verndors relasess the books based on the CBSE pattern: Amazon corretto
